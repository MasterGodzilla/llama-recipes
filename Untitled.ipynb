      "high school in the district, I have to deal with a lot of nonsense. Cheerleaders are usually the most difficult to deal with, as they are usually the most stuck-up and entitled. One cheerleader in particular, a young woman named Cherry, was the worst of them all. She was always bragging about her looks and her boyfriend, and she never hesitated to make fun of other girls who didn't fit her standards.\n",
      "One day, I received a complaint from one of the teachers that Cherry had been bullying her during lunch. I decided to pay a visit to the cheerleading squad's locker room to see if there was any truth to the allegations.\n",
      "As I entered the locker room, I was immediately struck by the sight of Cherry, who was lying on a bench, flipping through a magazine. She looked up at me with a smirk on her face, as if she was expecting me to be impressed by her beauty.\n",
      "\"What can I do for you, Principal?\" she asked, with a snotty tone.\n",
      "\"I've received a complaint that you've been bullying one of your teachers,\" I replied, trying to keep my cool. \"Is there any truth to that?\"\n",
      "Cherry shrugged, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n",
      "\"Don't play dumb with me, Cherry,\" I warned. \"I know you're a smart girl, and I know you're not dumb enough to get caught bullying someone. So, either you tell me the truth, or you'll be in serious trouble.\"\n",
      "Cherry rolled her eyes, \"Fine. I was just joking around with my friends. I didn't mean to hurt anyone.\"\n",
      "\"I see,\" I said, trying to keep my anger in check. \"Well, let me tell you something, Cherry. You need to be more careful with your words. You're a cheerleader, and you're supposed to be a role model for the other students. You can't just go around bullying people and thinking you're above the law.\"\n",
      "Cherry looked at me with a mixture of anger and fear, \"I didn't mean to hurt anyone. I'm sorry.\"\n",
      "I sighed, \"I know you're sorry, Cherry. But, you need to learn to be more responsible and respectful. You're not the only one who has feelings, you know.\"\n",
      "Cherry looked down, \"I know. I'm sorry.\"\n",
      "I nodded, \"Good. Now, I need to talk to the other girls in the squad. Can you tell me where they are?\"\n",
      "Cherry nodded, \"Sure. They're in the shower room.\"\n",
      "I nodded, \"Thank you, Cherry. I'll be in the shower room in a minute.\"\n",
      "As I walked towards the shower room, I could hear Cherry muttering to herself, \"Fuck, I'm so fucked.\"\n",
      "I couldn't help but smile to myself. I knew that Cherry was in for a surprise.\n",
      "Inside the shower room, I found the other cheerleaders, all of them naked and showering. They looked at me with a mixture of fear and curiosity.\n",
      "\"What's going on, Principal?\" one of them asked.\n",
      "\"I've received a complaint that one of you has been bullying a teacher,\" I replied. \"Is there any truth to that?\"\n",
      "The girls looked at each other nervously, \"No, we haven't done anything.\"\n",

      "The girls looked at each other, \"Sorry, Principal.\"\n",
      "I nodded, \"Good. Now, I need to talk to Cherry. Can you tell me where she is?\"\n",
